# sane-tab-enforcer

Helps keep the crazy cooks with too many tabs under control.

Idea courtesy of [Steph Hippo](https://github.com/StephHippo).

This silly Chrome extension is designed to keep your tab usage under control:
You're allowed a maximum of 12 tabs open. Once the 13th tab is opened, all tabs
are closed.

### Usage
- go to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
- enable `developer mode` with the checkbox in the upper right corner
- click `Load unpacked extension...` at the top of the page
- direct the file browser to the cloned `sane-tab-enforcer` ([ZIP][repo-zip]) directory

[repo-zip]: archive/master.zip
